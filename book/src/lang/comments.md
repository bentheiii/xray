# Comments
Comments in XRay come in two forms: single line comments and multi-line comments.
## Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with `//` and continue until the end of the line.
```xray
// this is a single line comment
```
## Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with `/*` and continue until they are closed with `*/`.
```xray
/* this is a multi-line comment
   it can span multiple lines */
```
